# [Lookahead and Lookbehind Zero-Length Assertions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html)

Lookahead and lookbehind, collectively called “lookaround”, are zero-length assertions just like the [start and end of line](https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html), and [start and end of word](https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html) anchors explained earlier in this tutorial. The difference is that lookaround actually matches characters, but then gives up the match, returning only the result: match or no match. That is why they are called “assertions”. They do not consume characters in the string, but only assert whether a match is possible or not. Lookaround allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them, or that would get very longwinded without them.
