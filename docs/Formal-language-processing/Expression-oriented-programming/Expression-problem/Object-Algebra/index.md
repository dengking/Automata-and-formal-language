This page documents solutions to the **Expression Problem** using **object algebras**. These solutions are meant to illustrate the use of **object algebras** in various programming languages. **Object algebras** and a solution to the Expression Problem in Java were presented in the paper:

[Extensibility for the Masses: Practical Extensibility with Object Algebras](http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~bruno/papers/ecoop2012.pdf)

*Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira and William R. Cook*

The source code for the paper can be found [here](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~bruno/oa/OA_Java.zip).

Reading the paper is recommended for understanding the code in the solutions as this web page only contains very limited information.

If you have a solution for the **expression problem** in your favourite language, and that language is not listed here, please consider sending it to us. We will publish it here together with the information about the author responsible for it.
