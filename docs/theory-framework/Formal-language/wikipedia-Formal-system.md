# [Formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system)

A **formal system** is used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the **logical calculus** of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an "[axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system)". In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use such system as the foundation for the knowledge in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics). A formal system may represent a well-defined [system of abstract thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction).

## Background

Each formal system uses primitive [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(formal)) (which collectively form an [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(computer_science))) to finitely construct a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) from a set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) through inferential [rules of formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_formation).
