形式语言

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), a **formal language** consists of [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) whose [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(formal)) are taken from an [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(computer_science)) and are [well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formedness) according to a specific set of rules. 

The [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(computer_science)) of a formal language consist of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language#cite_note-1) Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a **word**, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called *well-formed words* or *[well-formed formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula)*. A formal language is often defined by means of a [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) such as a [regular grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar) or [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), which consists of its [formation rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_rule). 

The field of **formal language theory** studies primarily the purely [syntactical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax)（语法） aspects of such languages—that is, their **internal structural patterns**. **Formal language theory** sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities（规律） of [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language). In computer science, **formal languages** are used among others as the basis for defining the **grammar** of [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)（语义）. In [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory), [decision problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem) are typically defined as **formal languages**, and [complexity classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class) are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be [parsed by machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser) with limited computational power. In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and the [foundations of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics), formal languages are used to represent the syntax of [axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system), and [mathematical formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(mathematics)) is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.
