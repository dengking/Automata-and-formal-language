**Symbolic computation** is the sub-area of **mathematics** and **computer science** which solves problems on ***symbolic objects*** representable on a computer. Typical examples of such objects are

- algebraic expressions,
- logical propositions, and
- programs themselves.

The problem solutions are integrated in many advanced software systems for ***computer algebra, computer aided design and manufacturing, computer supported reasoning, knowledge management, and formal system specification and verification.*** Besides playing a fundamental role within mathematics itself, symbolic computation is thus a key technology in many scientific and technical areas today.

More than any other area, symbolic computation depends on the integration of the
![Symbolic Computation](https://risc.jku.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SC-600x318.png)

- theoretical foundations (mathematics, logics, algorithms),
- the implementation in software systems, and the
- practical applications.

It is a main objective of the ***symbolic computation curriculum***(课程) at RISC to unite these three aspects. Graduates of this program are not only experts in symbolic computation but, due to their work in highly **abstract models** with the goal to develop effective software solutions, also professionals in developing innovative computer-based solutions for challenging problems arising in theoretical investigations and real-world applications. Therefore they are highly qualified to find their place in ***research and development***, in ***academia and industry***.

Within the realm(领域) of symbolic computation, research at RISC mainly falls into three general categories:

- **![Symbolic Computation at RISC](https://risc.jku.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SC2.png)Computer Algebra**

    We design and implement algorithms that operate on algebraic expressions; typical application areas are e.g. (algebraic) geometry and (algorithmic) combinatorics.

- **Computational Logic**

    We work on the specification, management, and derivation of knowledge expressed in the language of symbolic logic (resulting in software systems for supporting mathematical proving) and on the theory of computation.

- **Mathematical Software**

    We develop various symbolic computation software such as it occurs in computer algebra systems and theorem provers and study the logical foundations of software for the purpose of formal system specification and verification.

These categories (which present different views to the same field with strong overlappings and interrelationships) are also reflected in the RISC curriculum. See this [list of applications](https://risc.jku.at/applications/) for sample outcomes of this research.
