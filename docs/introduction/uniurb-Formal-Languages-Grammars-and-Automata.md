## Grammars and formal languages

### Chomsky

[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) (1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, and activist.

In [Syntactic Structures (1957)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures), Chomsky models knowledge of language using a [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar), by claiming that formal grammars can explain the ability of a hearer/speaker to produce and interpret an
infinite（无限的） number of sentences with a limited set of grammatical rules and a finite set of terms.

The human brain contains a limited set of rules for organizing language, known as [Universal Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar). The basic rules of grammar are hard-wired into the brain, and manifest themselves without being taught.

>  The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [structural rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar) are [innate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori)（先天的） to humans, independent of [sensory experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_experience). 

Chomsky proposed a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) that partitions **formal grammars** into classes with increasing expressive power, i.e. each successive class can generate a broader set of formal languages than the one before.

Interestingly, modeling some aspects of human language requires a more complex **formal grammar** (as measured by the Chomsky hierarchy) than modeling others.

#### Example

While a [regular language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language) is powerful enough to model English morphology（词法） (symbols, words), it is not powerful enough to model English syntax.

## Computer science and formal languages

Two application settings:

Formal languages are studied in [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and computer science.



### Computer science

In **computer science**, [formal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) are used for the precise definition of programming languages and, therefore, in the development of compilers.

A compiler is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language) $^a$ .

> $^a$ The most common reason for transforming source code is to create an executable program.

Computer scientists privilege a recognition approach based on [abstract machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine) ([automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory)) that take in input a sentence and decide whether it belongs to the reference language.

计算机科学家使用一种基于抽象机器(automata)的识别方法，这种机器接收输入的句子，然后判断它是否属于参考语言。

### Automata and formal languages

#### Turing, Kleene, ...

Stephen Kleene introduced **finite automata** in the 50s: abstract state machines equipped with a finite memory. He demonstrated the equivalence between such a model and the description of sequences of
symbols using only three logical primitives (set union, set product, and iteration).

Alan Turing (and, independently, Emil Post and John Backus) put the ideas underlying the notion of **pushdown automata**: abstract state machines with an unbounded memory that is accessible only through a restricted mode (called a stack).

艾伦·图灵(以及独立的埃米尔·波斯特和约翰·巴克斯)提出了下推自动机概念的基本思想:具有无限内存的抽象状态机，只能通过受限模式(称为堆栈)访问。

In 1936, Alan Turing described the Turing Machine: an abstract state machine equipped with an infinite memory in the form of a strip of tape. Turing machines simulate the logic of any computer algorithm
and recognize the larger class of **formal languages**.



## Automata and grammars

#### Which class of formal languages is recognized by a given type of automata?

There is an equivalence between the Chomsky hierarchy and the different kinds of automata. Thus, theorems about formal languages can be dealt with as either grammars or automata.

Formal languages theory:

|   generative approach   | recognition approach |
| :---------------------: | :------------------: |
| Grammars classification |   Automata theory    |

#### Describing formal languages: generative approach

##### Generative approach

A language is the set of strings generated by a [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar).

##### Generation process

- Start symbol
- Expand with rewrite rules.
- Stop when a word of the language is generated.

##### Pros and Cons

- The generative approach is appealing to humans.
- Grammars are formal, informative, compact, finite descriptions for possibly infinite languages, but are clearly inefficient if implemented naively.

#### Describing formal languages: recognition approach

##### Recognition approach

A language is the set of strings accepted by an [automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory).

##### Recognition process

- Start in initial state.
- Transitions to other states guided by the string symbols.
- Until read whole string and reach accept/reject state.

##### Pros and Cons

- The recognition approach is appealing to machines.
- Automata are formal, compact, low-level machines that can be implemented easily and efficiently, but can be hard to understand to humans.



## Formal languages: definition and basic notions

[Formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language):Is a set of words, that is, finite strings of symbols taken from the alphabet over which the language is defined. 

[Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(formal_languages)): a finite, non-empty set of symbols.

Example:

```
Σ 1 = {0,1}
Σ 2 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
Σ 3 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F }
Σ 4 = {a,b,c,...,z }
```
