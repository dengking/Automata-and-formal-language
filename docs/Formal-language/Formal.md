## Examples of formal 

### example 1

[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf)的Chapter 1 Introduction的如下描述：

> In the early days of artificial intelligence, the field rapidly tackled and solved problems that are intellectually difficult for human beings but relatively straightforward for computers—problems that can be described by a list of **formal**, mathematical rules. The true challenge to artificial intelligence proved to be solving the tasks that are easy for people to perform but hard for people to describe
> **formally**—problems that we solve **intuitively**, that feel automatic, like recognizing spoken words or faces in images.

formal-》fixed problem

intuitive-》AI

### example 2

[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf)的Chapter 5.1 Learning Algorithms的如下描述：

>  “A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some class of tasks `T` and performance measure `P` , if its performance at tasks in `T` , as measured by `P` , improves with experience `E` .” One can imagine a very wide variety of experiences `E` , tasks `T` , and performance measures `P` , and we do not make any attempt in this book to provide a **formal definition** of what may be used for each of these entities. Instead, the following sections provide **intuitive descriptions** and examples of the different kinds of tasks, performance measures and experiences that can be used to construct machine learning algorithms.

## 什么是formal？

关于formal的直觉是：

- 有固定的规则

### 维基百科formal汇总

我们需要重点关注三个科学学科：

[Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal#Linguistics)、[Logic and mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal#Logic_and_mathematics)、[Computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal#Computer_science)

这三个学科中的formal是密切相关的。

文章[Formalism (philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy)), [Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics))将formal描述为一种科学的思想，显然它从更高的哲学的角度来概括formal，我觉得以它作为掌握formal的入口是非常好的，因为科学总数遵循相同的哲学思想，或者说哲学指导着科学。
