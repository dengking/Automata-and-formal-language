# Axiom Schema

"axiom schema"的中文意思是"公理模式"。我是在阅读wikipedia [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy) 中发现它的:

> A [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) provides an [axiom schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema) for (or *generates*) a *formal language*, which is a (usually infinite) set of [finite-length sequences of symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) that may be constructed by applying [production rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science)) to another sequence of symbols (which initially contains just the start symbol). A rule may be applied by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on its left-hand side with those that appear on its right-hand side. A sequence of rule applications is called a *derivation*. Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.

## wikipedia [Axiom schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema)

In [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic), an **axiom schema** (plural: **axiom schemata** or **axiom schemas**) generalizes the notion of [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom).

> NOTE: 推广了axiom的概念。以 [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) 为例，formal grammar中的production就是axiom。
