# Automata-and-formal-language
Grasp of [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) can help understand the design of compiler, the design of regular expression and even more. They play an important role in computer science, it is better for programmer to master it.

The content of this repository is mainly taken from wikipedia, I reorganize them and supplement some materials.
