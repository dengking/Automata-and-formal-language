# Automata-and-formal-language
This repository record my exploration of [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language). I begin explore this two relating theory after I read part of the [dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools).

As a programmer, grasp of [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) matters because the [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) we live on is a kind of [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is also relevant to [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). In Wikepedia's introduction to [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), you will find it has wide application in many subjects.

[Automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory)  is closely related to formal language theory.


It can help understand the design of compiler, the design of regular expression and even more. They play an important role in computer science, it is better for programmer to know it.
