# Automata-and-formal-language
As a programmer, understanding of language matters because the [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) we live in is a kinid of language, called [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). Besides, [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is also relevant to [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. [Automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory)  is closely related to formal language theory.

Grasp of [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) can help understand the design of compiler, the design of regular expression and even more. They play an important role in computer science, it is better for programmer to master it.

The content of this repository is mainly taken from wikipedia, I reorganize them and supplement some materials.
